# 🐉 DnD Smart Pointer — University C++ Project

## 📌 Overview

**DnD Smart Pointer** is a university C++ project that demonstrates a custom implementation of smart pointers through a **Dungeons & Dragons–inspired domain model**.

Instead of abstract examples, smart pointers are applied to manage game entities (such as characters, items, or interactions), making memory management concepts more practical and easier to understand in a real-world–like scenario.

This project focuses on safe resource ownership, object lifetime management, and modern C++ design principles.

## ✨ Key Concepts & Features

- Custom implementation of smart pointers in C++
- Application of **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**
- Smart pointer usage in a game-inspired (DnD) context
- Safe ownership and automatic resource cleanup
- Template-based design
- Operator overloading for intuitive pointer behavior
- Improved readability through domain-based modeling

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **C++** — core programming language  
- **Templates** — generic programming  
- **RAII & Smart Pointers** — custom memory management  
- **Object-Oriented Programming** — domain modeling  
- **Git / GitHub** — version control

## 👩‍💻 My Role

This project was completed individually as part of a **university C++ course**.

My responsibilities included:

- Designing and implementing custom smart pointer logic
- Applying smart pointers to manage game-related objects
- Modeling entities inspired by the DnD game domain
- Ensuring safe memory management and object lifetimes
- Writing clean, maintainable, and well-structured C++ code
